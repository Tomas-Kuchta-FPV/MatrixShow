 - [x] Figure out what to do
     - [x] Make first with AI
         - [x] Then fail miserably
 - [x] Write my own code

 - [x] Implement a framework for the matrix
 - [ ] Implement Preview mode - its just one way for now it should be for both ways
 - [ ] Write HAl for Sonoff DIY mode as I won't be using zigbee
~~ - [ ] Using Home asssitant for HAl would be probably better - if SonoffLAN suported it ~~
 - [ ] Implement more LightEffects
 - [ ] Make a pretty light show ;)
